LLM API-Powered Job Listings Data Cleaning Tool: Showcase for Data Scientists

This project leverages Large Language Model (LLM) API technology to automate the cleaning and transformation of job listings for data scientists. It filters postings based on criteria like location and salary, using LLM APIs to enhance data accuracy and usability, streamlining the job search process. Explore how AI revolutionizes job data handling for more efficient, targeted career advancement.



# 1. Define the Problem

### Objective
Showcase the application of Large Language Model (LLM) API technology in cleaning and transforming job listings data to highlight the most relevant opportunities for data scientists. This project aims to demonstrate the power of LLM APIs in automating the extraction, cleaning, and enrichment of job postings from various websites based on specified criteria such as location, salary, company size, and preferred tech stack, thereby streamlining the job search process for data science professionals.

### Key Inquiries
- Which industry demonstrates the highest demand for Data Scientists?
- Which industry offers the most competitive average salary?
- Which industries mandate educational qualifications beyond a bachelor's degree?
- Which industries predominantly require on-site presence, and which ones permit remote work?
- What correlation exists between salary levels and remote work availability?



# 2. Data Collection

### Data Sources
- **SerpAPI**: Leverages the "google_jobs" engine to fetch relevant job listings.
- **Documentation URL**: [SerpAPI Google Jobs API](https://serpapi.com/google-jobs-api)

### Reason for Selecting SerpAPI
The choice of SerpAPI is driven by its capability to source job listings from a multitude of platforms, coupled with its offer of a free tier for API queries.

### Implementation of a Custom Job Search Enhancement
To address the limitation of receiving only 10 job results per API call within the free tier of SerpAPI's Google Jobs engine, a specialized Python class has been developed. This class is capable of fetching additional pages, thereby significantly increasing the volume of unique job listings obtained.

# 3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

![Data Preparation - Raw Duplicates](https://github.com/Prvargas/job-webscraper/blob/main/img/C%20-%20Dataprep_Raw_Duplicates.png)


### Handling Duplicates
Initially, the "job_id" column was assessed for identifying duplicate job listings. However, the analysis revealed that the "description" field is more suitable for this task. To address duplicates effectively, a bespoke function was developed specifically for identifying duplicates based on the job description.




# 4. Data Transformation

The OpenAI ChatGPT chat completion API was used to transform the raw job listings data. This approach overcomes max token issues as well as memory context loss issues.

### PROMPT USED IN API CALLS

Only reply in JSON format. 

This is the logic for transforming each column from the original data to the new structure:
- **title**: Check the original title against a predefined list of job titles. If the title is one of "Data Scientist", "Data Analyst", "Machine Learning Engineer", "Data Engineer", "Business Intelligence (BI) Analyst", it remains unchanged; otherwise, it is transformed to "Other".
- **leadership**: Extract from the original title leadership titles like "Team Lead", "Supervisor", "Manager", "Director", "Executive", or "None".
- **focus**: Extract any variations or specializations from the original title that are not part of the standard job titles listed above. If the title is "Marketing Data Analyst", the focus is "Marketing".
- **experience_level**: Analyze the description to determine the experience required:
  - "Entry" for descriptions mentioning 0 to 1 year of experience.
  - "Mid" for descriptions mentioning 2 to 4 years of experience.
  - "Senior" for descriptions mentioning more than 5 years of experience.
- **company_name**: Retain the company names in proper case as they appear.
- **company_industry**: Infer the industry from the company name or description, such as "Retail" for Walmart. For TikTok, which is known for social media, the industry is "Social Media".
- **location**: Use the full location as provided, typically including city and sometimes state or country.
- **city**: Extract the city portion from the location column.
- **state**: Extract the state portion from the location column.
- **remote**: Determine the job work arrangement from the description or extensions, using only "Remote", "On-Site", "Hybrid", or "Ambiguous". If the description mentions a hybrid work schedule, the value is "Hybrid".
- **salary_range**: 
  - Format the salary information into ``"$100k - $130k"`` format or ``"$100k"`` if a single salary is provided. For the given salary range of ``$108,300 to $228,000``, it would be formatted as ``"$108k - $228k"``.
  - If an hourly wage is provided, calculate the annual salary range by multiplying the hourly wage by 40 hours per week, then by 52 weeks per year. Format the result as a range in the format ``"$100k - $130k"``. If the result does not neatly fit into the "k" formatting, round the salary to the nearest thousand and use the appropriate "k" notation.
  - Using the given range of ``$26.20 to $51.39 hourly``, the annual salary range would be approximately ``$54,496 to $106,995``, which would be formatted as ``"$54k - $107k"``.
- **salary_min and salary_max**: Convert the given salary range into integer minimum and maximum values.
- **employment_type**: Extract the employment type from the description or extensions, which should be "Full-Time", "Part-Time", or "Contract". The provided example indicates "Full-Time".
- **required_education**: Determine the minimum required education from the job description. The options are "None", "Bachelors", "Masters", or "Ph.D". Given that the description mentions BS/MS degrees, the required education is "Bachelors".



Example JSON Response:
```JSON
{
  "title": "Data Scientist",
  "leadership": "Supervisor",
  "focus": "Product Analytics",
  "experience_level": "Senior",
