SNAP\u2019s mission was, and is, to provide people of low income with access to needed resources, and to help them make the kinds of connections that create opportunity. Our goal always has been to help build a vibrant community that treats everyone with dignity and respect by advocating for that which is fair, honorable and equitable.\n\nThe foundation for what is now SNAP got its start in the summer of 1966, when Father Frank Bach, then the director of Catholic Charities in Spokane, enlisted the assistance of the St. Vincent DePaul Society to establish three community centers, in Hillyard, East Central and West Central Spokane, each with a goal of helping low-income people meet their emergency needs as well as to provide a multitude of services within those communities.\n\nThese centers and the community-based programs they initiated were so successful that the Spokane Community Action Agency took over the administration of the neighborhood centers. Unfortunately, that agency lost its funding in the summer of 1973. The programs would have been lost were it not for the intervention of a number of community leaders. New funding was secured and Catholic Charities again administered the program.\n\nStriving to fill growing needs, the Neighborhood Centers had developed an annual budget in excess of $4 million by 1985 and were growing beyond the scope of Catholic Charities. On September 12, 1985, with Tom Pleas as Director, the centers became Spokane Neighborhood Centers, Inc. The incorporators were: P.J. Grabicki, Thelma Pugh, Robert Huckabay, Sheri Barnard, Clarence (Bud) Barnes, Nora Beggs, Ed Stevens and Bill Fearn. The corporation adopted bylaws on December 10, 1985.\n\nFive years after incorporation, leadership shifted with the announced retirement of Director Pleas. The agency\u2019s associate director, Larry Stuckart, was formally named executive director in July 1992. Julie Honekamp assumed the role of SNAP and SNAP Financial Access CEO in June of 2011.\n\nFrom 1985 through the present, the agency has expanded services to meet the needs of a growing population, proving itself to be more than just \u201cneighborhood centers.\u201d Through continuing expansion and a variety of programs, the agency strives to facilitate long-term solutions for the people it serves.\n\nThe agency officially became Spokane Neighborhood Action Programs in December 1991, a name chosen to reflect the breadth of the agency\u2019s operations. In Sheri S. Barnard\u2019s Mayoral Proclamation, the agency pledged to continue providing quality services and to ensure that Spokane remains a place that cares about its citizens. In 2008, the name was officially shortened to \u201cSNAP\u201d and legally changed to Spokane Neighborhood Action Partners.\n\nWith a re-energized mission, vision and values statement, as well as a new visual identity, SNAP continues to respond to individual and community needs by providing a range of opportunities that offer stability to our vulnerable neighbors and encourage economic self-sufficiency for those who are able.\n\nCompany Size:\n100 to 499 employees\n\nIndustry:\nNonprofit Charitable Organizations\n\nFounded:\n1966\n\nWebsite:\nhttps:\/\/www.snapwa.org","52":"Last updated : 2024-03-02","53":"About Us:\nSynergistic IT is a full-service staffing and placement firm servicing client in America for the past 12+ years.
